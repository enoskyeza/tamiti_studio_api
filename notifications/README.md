# Notifications App

## Model Fields
- `id` (UUID)
- `user` – ForeignKey to `accounts.User`
- `content` – Text content of the notification
- `related_task` – ForeignKey to `tasks.Task`
- `read` – Boolean flag indicating if the notification has been read
- `timestamp` – Date and time the notification was created
- `level` – Importance level (`info`, `alert`, `critical`)

## Signal Emitters
Notifications are created in response to signals from other apps:
- **User events** – `post_save` on `users.User` can trigger welcome or profile notifications.
- **Task lifecycle** – creation, assignment, or completion of `tasks.Task` instances emits notifications to assignees and project members.

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/notifications/` – list notifications for the authenticated user
- `GET /api/notifications/<id>/` – retrieve a single notification
- `POST /api/notifications/<id>/read/` – mark a notification as read

These endpoints allow clients to fetch and manage in-app and email notifications generated by the system.
