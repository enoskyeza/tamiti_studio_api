# Django Project and Task Apps Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the Django project and task management system, including Kanban board functionality, enhanced comment threading with @mentions, and a robust fine-grained permissions system.

## 1. Enhanced Models and Data Structure

### Projects App Updates
- **Added `client_email` field** to Project model for better client management
- **Enhanced Project model** with mockup-compatible properties:
  - `progress` - calculated project completion percentage
  - `startDate`, `endDate` - formatted date properties
  - `clientName`, `clientEmail` - client information properties
  - `assignedUsers` - list of assigned users with details

### Tasks App Updates
- **Enhanced Task model** with multiple user/team assignment support:
  - `assigned_users` - ManyToMany field for multiple user assignments
  - `assigned_teams` - ManyToMany field for team assignments
  - Kanban positioning fields (`kanban_column`, `kanban_position`)
- **Added Kanban models**:
  - `KanbanBoard` - represents project Kanban boards
  - `KanbanColumn` - represents columns within boards with status mapping
- **Updated enums**:
  - Changed `PriorityLevel.CRITICAL` to `PriorityLevel.URGENT`
  - Added `TaskStatus.REVIEW` status

## 2. Kanban Board System

### Features Implemented
- **Full Kanban board management** with drag-and-drop support
- **Column-based task organization** with status mapping
- **Position management** for task ordering within columns
- **WIP (Work In Progress) limits** for columns
- **Board initialization** with default columns based on task statuses

### API Endpoints
- `GET/POST /api/tasks/kanban/boards/` - List/create Kanban boards
- `GET /api/tasks/kanban/boards/{id}/` - Get board details with columns and tasks
- `POST /api/tasks/kanban/boards/{id}/initialize/` - Initialize board with default columns
- `POST /api/tasks/kanban/move-task/` - Move tasks between columns
- `POST /api/tasks/kanban/reorder-task/` - Reorder tasks within columns

### Frontend Integration
- Comprehensive API documentation with React/TypeScript examples
- Drag-and-drop implementation guidance
- Real-time task movement and position updates

## 3. Enhanced Comments System

### Threading Support
- **1-level deep reply threads** - users can reply to comments but not to replies
- **Parent-child relationship** with proper validation
- **Reply listing** with chronological ordering

### @Mention Functionality
- **User mention extraction** from comment content using regex
- **ManyToMany relationship** to mentioned users
- **Mention search API** for user autocomplete
- **Notification integration** ready for mentioned users

### API Endpoints
- `GET/POST /api/comments/` - List/create top-level comments
- `POST /api/comments/{id}/replies/` - Create reply to comment
- `GET /api/comments/{id}/replies/list/` - Get all replies for comment
- `GET /api/comments/search-users/` - Search users for mentions
- `POST /api/comments/{id}/toggle-internal/` - Toggle internal status

## 4. Comprehensive Permissions System

### Architecture
- **Flexible permission model** supporting:
  - User and group-based permissions
  - Allow/deny permissions with deny precedence
  - Global, object-specific, and field-specific permissions
  - Content type based permissions for any model
  - Priority-based conflict resolution

### Permission Models
- `Permission` - Core permission with action, scope, and assignment
- `PermissionGroup` - Groups of related permissions for easier management
- `UserPermissionCache` - Performance optimization with caching
- `PermissionLog` - Audit trail for all permission checks

### Permission Actions
- `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `LIST`
- Extensible for custom actions

### Permission Scopes
- `GLOBAL` - Applies to all instances of a model
- `OBJECT` - Applies to specific object instances
- `FIELD` - Applies to specific model fields

### Integration Tools
- **Mixins** for Django views and DRF viewsets
- **Decorators** for function-based views
- **Permission classes** for DRF integration
- **Service layer** for programmatic permission checking

### API Endpoints
- `GET/POST /api/permissions/permissions/` - Manage permissions
- `GET/POST /api/permissions/permission-groups/` - Manage permission groups
- `GET /api/permissions/permission-logs/` - View audit logs
- `POST /api/permissions/check-permission/` - Check user permissions
- `GET /api/permissions/user-permissions/` - Get user permission summary
- `POST /api/permissions/clear-cache/` - Clear permission cache

### Admin Interface
- **Full admin integration** with intuitive interfaces
- **Permission management** with filtering and search
- **Audit log viewing** with detailed information
- **Cache management** with cleanup actions

## 5. Database Migrations

All changes have been successfully migrated:
- **Comments migrations** - Added threading and mention fields
- **Tasks migrations** - Added Kanban fields and models
- **Permissions migrations** - Created complete permission system
- **Common migrations** - Added BaseModel for consistent timestamps

## 6. API Documentation

### Swagger/OpenAPI Integration
- **Complete API documentation** with drf-spectacular
- **Interactive API explorer** available at `/api/docs/`
- **Schema validation** for all endpoints
- **Example requests/responses** for frontend integration

### Frontend Integration Guides
- **Kanban API Guide** (`docs/KANBAN_API_GUIDE.md`) with React examples
- **Permission system usage** examples and best practices
- **Comment threading** implementation guidance

## 7. Security and Performance

### Security Features
- **Permission-based access control** at API and queryset level
- **Audit logging** for all permission checks
- **Soft delete** support with restoration capabilities
- **Input validation** and sanitization

### Performance Optimizations
- **Permission caching** with configurable timeouts
- **Database indexing** for efficient queries
- **Queryset optimization** with select_related and prefetch_related
- **Bulk operations** for permission management

## 8. Usage Examples

### Using Permissions in Views
```python
from permissions.mixins import PermissionModelViewSet
from permissions.decorators import permission_required

class TaskViewSet(PermissionModelViewSet):
    queryset = Task.objects.all()
    serializer_class = TaskSerializer

@permission_required('update', 'tasks.task')
def update_task_status(request, task_id):
    # View logic here
    pass
```

### Checking Permissions Programmatically
```python
from permissions.services import permission_service

has_permission = permission_service.has_permission(
    user=request.user,
    action='update',
    content_type='tasks.task',
    obj=task_instance
)
```

### Kanban Task Movement
```python
# Move task to different column
POST /api/tasks/kanban/move-task/
{
    "task_id": 123,
    "target_column_id": 456,
    "position": 2
}
```

### Creating Comment with Mentions
```python
POST /api/comments/
{
    "content": "Great work @john.doe! Please review this task.",
    "target_type": "tasks.task",
    "target_id": 123
}
```
