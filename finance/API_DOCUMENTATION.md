## Recent Updates & Bug Fixes

### January 2024 - Version 1.0

- âœ… Updated `transaction_type` to `type` in PersonalTransactionRecurring model
- âœ… Changed `budgeted_amount` to `allocated_amount` in PersonalBudget model
- âœ… Updated `title` to `name` in PersonalSavingsGoal model
- âœ… Fixed `next_execution_date` to `next_due_date` for recurring transactions
- âœ… Corrected property names: `spent_percentage` â†’ `progress_percentage`, `is_over_budget` â†’ `is_exceeded`
- âœ… Added missing analytics serializers for dashboard endpoints
- âœ… Fixed admin interface field references
